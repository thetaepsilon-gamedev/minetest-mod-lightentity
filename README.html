<h2>lightentity</h2>
<p>
Adds a "light entity" and invisible light source nodes to the game.
</p>

<p>
Every server tick this entity will check it's current position to see if it's target node has moved.
If it has, the entity will clean up the old node if it's still there,
then place a new one in the new position if there is air there.
This gives the impression of a light source which moves around, following the entity.
</p>

<p>
Corresponding nodes for all possible light source levels are generated.
These are invisible, light-emitting nodes that can be placed into,
so they can be cleaned up if one gets stuck somewhere
(in the same manner as removing a lighting glitch).
The entity supports specifying the light level to emit at,
as well as the offset relative to it to use as the target node.
</p>

<h2>Usage in mods</h2>
<p>
The "lightentity:light" entity accepts parameter data in json form for the staticdata string when spawned from minetest.add_entity().
</p>
<pre>
{
	"lightlevel": 14,
	"offset": {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}
}
</pre>
<ul>
	<li>
	lightlevel is the level of light that should be "emitted" by the entity.
	Will be coerced to within 1 - minetest.LIGHT_MAX with a warning if not within that range.
	</li>
	<li>
	offset is a typical minetest coordinate xyz vector which is added to the entity's base position,
	to determine where the light source should be at that moment in time.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>
The game engine does not allow mods to create a "lighting glitch" by adjusting the param1 value of nodes with paramtype="light" in their node definition.
It seems that the engine immediately notices that the node is not a light source after the call to set/swap_node().
Therefore the entity has to emit light by spawning a light-emitting invisible node;
it is very conservative about how it does this, currently only replacing air nodes with it's own,
so it won't work if e.g. the entity is inside a non-solid node or underwater
(though this may be the intended effect depending on use case).
</p>
<p>
The entity itself can only update itself once per server tick, as that is how frequently on_step() is invoked.
If the entity is moving quickly (say by being attached to a player with fast_move),
the light source updates will appear to be jittery and may visually lag behind any parent entity.
</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>
It is variable how much extra load this will generate on a server.
There is very little overhead in this mod and it is pretty much as simple as it can be;
it is likely that there will be more load caused by re-lighting
(though this does not occur if the entity does not move).
Completely unscientific testing on a server running on an 2.80Ghz Intel Xeon W3530
(by spawning the entity, attaching it to a minecart and putting it on a powered rail loop)
suggests a ballpark figure for 1-2% extra CPU time used for one of these entities while constantly moving.
The entity does not appear to cause load when stationary;
this is likely because it does not change nodes if it is still positioned within the same target node from a previous tick.
</p>
<p>
Server owners should evaluate this on their own servers before use;
see the below example commands that can be used for this purpose.
<em>Mods using this API are expected to provide config options to disable dynamic lighting</em>,
or at least add reasonable limitation to how light entities are used.
If this gets abused I may consider either a global disable, a mechanism to blacklist mods,
or a mechanism to limit the update speed globally.
I am open to any other suggestions from server owners looking to reduce the load potentially caused by this mod.
</p>

<h2>Example uses</h2>
<p>
This mod by itself does NOT add anything useable in survival.
It is intended to be used in other mods, and the entity moved/attached as needed
(e.g. by a mod which spawns the entity attached to a player when they wield a torch).
That said, below are some commands that can be used with the "luacmd" mod by server admins to evaluate the impact on a server,
though it is expected that you understand what these commands are doing:
</p>
<pre>
/lua lightref = minetest.add_entity(me:get_pos(), "lightentity:light", "{\"lightlevel\": 14, \"offset\": {\"x\": 0, \"y\": 1, \"z\": 0}}")

/lua lightref:set_attach(me, "light_tether", {}, {})
</pre>
